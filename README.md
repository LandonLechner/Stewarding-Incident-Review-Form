I built this webpage to simplify the formatting process for my sim racing league's stewarding write-ups. Every week a team of drivers (known as stewards) review each accident from the last race and assign penalty points based on the outcome of the steward's rulings. Each steward reviews the accidents one by one and writes out an opinion in our Discord server using similar but different formats. I found the formatting process to slow down my process, and I saw an opportunity to build another practice project. This project is the result. I am particularly proud of my Javascript coding in updateTextarea function, which I built in such a way as to leave room for new formatting preferences if necessary.
